## 📖 About The Project

**Wordless - Practice Edition** is a custom implementation of the word-guessing logic. The goal of this project was to:

1.  Recreate the specific game mechanics (handling guesses, letter states, and validation) from scratch.
2.  Practice DOM manipulation and responsive UI design.

It serves as a playground for testing algorithms and frontend architecture.

## 🎮 How to Play (Practice Mode)

Guess the hidden word to solve the puzzle.

- Validates guesses against a dictionary.
- Provides visual feedback on letter accuracy.

This "Practice Edition" is built to test the underlying code and logic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling:** CSS Grid / Flexbox
- **Logic:** Custom JavaScript algorithms for word validation and state management.
